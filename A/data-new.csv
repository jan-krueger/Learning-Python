-changed calulation period for forecast (02/17/13 - today) to get a better prediction.
-changed calculations in the background to make less expensive in calculation CPU requirements.
-changed the linear regression starting of 01/01/2015. Will give a good picture if we make some of those jumps every few month
Added linear regression for the last 30 days and forecasting it. This is a good assumption on where we end up, if we continue as we did lately. Basically it is like putting a ruler on the Reality graph and draw a line. Again, taking 2015 values into account only.

Stpehen Dumbeck (Oct 9th 2016) - Updated the forcast to go to 2018. Updated pledge development, funding by month, and several other graphs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
